This assessment is a 2 Step Process. 
 
Step 1: Involves Testing your Ability to Convert High Fidelity Designs to Android XML 
 
Step 2:  Involves Testing your Ability to Integrate to 3rd Party APIs. This will cover both Integrating into a Rest API and Using FireBase Auth  
 
1.) Task 1- Converting UI to Android Designs 
 
	Create a sample Android App with implementation of 3 Screens as per the design below. 
	 
a.) Screen 1 - Login Screen 

 
b.) Screen 2 - Home Page 
		 

 
		 
		 
c.) Screen 3 - Car List Page 

 
	 
	Resources 
- A high fidelity sample of the designs for Screen 2 and Screen 3 can be found here https://dribbble.com/shots/9324676-Car-Rental-app 
		 
- For the App font use Ubuntu Font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) 
- Use any logo  of our choice for the Login Screen Logo 
- For the car images use any images of cars i.e. from https://unsplash.com/s/photos/car 
	 
	 
1. Task 2 - API Integration 
 Using the Login Screen Done in Step 1: Integrate the ability to Login using 
 
a.) The LOGIN REST endpoint available here https://reqres.in/ 
b.) On Successful Login Implement the SINGLE USER endpoint to fetch user details for user ID 2. You can use the endpoint /api/users/2 
c.) On your Login Screen add an extra button with the text FIRE LOGIN which will trigger a sign in using FirebaseAuth email & password. 
	For this last step you can create and integrate your own firebase app as it will only be usable for this taskâ€™s demo.
